Repository for Course work (Assignments and Project) on ATU Module **25-26: 4369 -- Programming for Data Analytics**   
</br>
This repository is organized into a series of folders named "assignments", "my-work", and "project".  


## Assignments  
* Each file in 'assignments' folder is clearly named according to Assignment Number   
* The files maybe jupyter notebooks or Python files that provide solutions to the assigned questions for that week.

## Big Project
<img src="./images/github_logo.png" alt="Github" width="200">  

For the main Project for this Module, I analyzed **Trends in Programming Languages** as seen from activity within the GitHub event streams.  
I used the GitHub API and other public datasets as a data source to look at Program Language Trends for the past 10 years with Github.  

While GitHub activity archives start from February 12, 2011, I will focus on past decade of records 2015-2025  

**I hope to gain insight into the following Programming Language Trends**
* Analyze which languages are growing/declining over time
* Analyze language switching patterns (Devs moving from language x to language y)
* Has the recent explosion of AI resulted in a rise of AI-related repositories 
    * How have these AI-related repositories grown in recent years
    * How does this growth compare with traditional languages
* Compare developer activity by geography and timezone
    * How does India and China compare with EU/US in github activity 
* Visualize the shift from older to newer languages
